# ENERGY-HARVESTING-SYSTEM-FOR-EV-CHARGING
This project develops energy harvesting systems for EVs to extend range and boost efficiency. It captures energy from sources like solar radiation, kinetic motion, and waste heat, converting it into electricity to support the onboard power supply, reduce charging frequency, and enhance overall sustainability.
